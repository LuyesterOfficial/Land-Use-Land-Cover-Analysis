# Land-Use-Land-Cover-Analysis
Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery of Indabettu watershed, for the year 2015 and 2019 are
downloaded from the public domain of United States of geological survey (USGS). Images
were processed for atmospheric corrections, including radiance – reflectance conversions.
Raster map calculator, available at Quantum GIS is used as a tool for all type of
processing.Further the most popular indices normalized difference vegetation index
(NDVI), and normalized difference built-up area index (NDBI). Image is divided from the
primary data. Hence two NVDI and NDBI Images are obtained for further change detection
analysis. In both the cases, pixel values infer about the presence or absence of relevant
features and the values remain from –1 to +1
